They both have very similar personalities. Momo and Mamu are insanely overpowered and rely mostly on brute force instead of magic. They also have very similar personalities. Momo and Mamu move in next door to Shamiko and Fujiyama. It's all just too on the nose to be a coincidence.",

Ranko is very obviously modeled after Syaro, they're not even trying to hide it. The café that they work at in Yumemiru is called Bloom, likely a reference to the final season of the GochiUsa animé of the same name. GochiUsa has a much slower and more engaging plot.",

Not only that, both stories compel you to deep dive and question the worlds too just like the protagonists. They're very meta and genre-bending, characteristic of their same author. - Foreshadowing: in so many cases, information that seems insignificant will complement new reveals that happen later on in the story. It really adds to the in-depthness of the world-building. The stories definitely have reread value. - Characters: despite the extremely fantastical settings, the characters' intentions are properly justifiable throughout the story (more so Omniscient Reader). It makes the world that much more immersive.",

While I'm recommending Ao Ashi, Oshi no Ko is another good choice. It's essentially the same as Ao Ashi but delves deeply into the entertainment industry instead, with added drama, mystery, and romance.",

While having the potential of a supernatural romance seems lovely, there is something sinister beneath the surface involving both ghosts. There is something mysterious going on with mysterious rituals, other ghosts, and the true nature of Aizawa and Aono. Both series have a lot of mystery, horror, and romance elements, and I like how they both take similar concepts and ideas and twist them in different ways. Mietamasu yo! Aizawa-san is not simply the yuri version of I Want to Hold Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die. Aono-kun has the couple get together quickly, while Aizawa-san is a lot more of a slow burn. They both introduce the horror and mystery of the world in different ways, with Aono seeming a bit more forward with triggering topics and Aizawa-san introducing the more overt horror and mystery elements more gradually. Aizawa-san also begins with a more comedic tone, particularly in the earliest chapters.",

The story is the same: a dragon from another world comes to this world injured and, by chance of fate, meets an overworked drunk office worker who rescues her, and as a token of appreciation, the dragon decides to work at her house as a maid. It is a downright amazing storyline, and it is a calm and steady slice-of-life storyline with some freakishly good fighting scenes, making it an all-around good manga to recommend. However, the quality of the storyline has degraded severely since the second season of the anime of the same name, but it still deserves a read and watch.",

So both series, miraculously, stay light and fluffy. The blackmailer in both have identical reasons for doing what they are doing and the one being blackmailed in both only put up mild resistance and quickly start to question if they actually have feelings for the blackmailer. Both series also feature a side story of unrequited love and regret. Where they differ is Ichido is R rated while Lonely Girl is very PG. That being said the blackmail is actually heavier in Lonely Girl than in Ichido as the blackmailer in Ichido feels remorse for her actions and eases off while the blackmailer in Lonely Girl is happy to be close to the girl being blackmailed and leans into it.",
